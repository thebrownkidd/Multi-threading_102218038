# Random Number Dashboard with Multithreading


## Description
This project demonstrates a Random Number Dashboard that displays six boxes where each box shows a random number generated from a specified range. Each number refreshes at a different interval using multithreading to ensure the GUI remains responsive.

## Input

- **Six different number ranges**:
  - [10, 20]
  - [-10, 10]
  - [-100, 0]
  - [0, 20]
  - [-40, 40]
  - [100, 200]

- **Refresh intervals**:
  - 10 seconds
  - 20 seconds
  - 8 seconds
  - 12 seconds
  - 16 seconds
  - 14 seconds
